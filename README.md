## Implementation Plan
3 sprints, with the following goals:
- Sprint 1
  - Core features of anonymous users web page (user pages with ratings, no login) implemented visually with spoofed data that mimcics actual data structures
- Sprint 2
  - Fully implemented core features (including login, authorized ratings, etc)
- Sprint 3
  - Data served fully from backend, attempt ot get all data from Riot API rather than spoofing anything (may require fake data just to show features)
